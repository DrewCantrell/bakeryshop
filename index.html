From showing them how to use a knife to opening and closing the oven safely to protecting their hands, there are many things to consider. Going through the basic rules in the kitchen is a great place to begin. Here are a few to get you started:
    <ul>1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.</ul>
    <ul>2. Don’t leave the kitchen unattended while cooking.</ul>
    <ul>3. Don’t leave flammable objects on the stovetop—even when it’s off.</ul>
    <ul>4. Always use a potholder or towel to carry hot items.</ul>
    <ul>5. Allow kitchen appliances to cool off before storing them.</ul>
